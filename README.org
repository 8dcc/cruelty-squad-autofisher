#+TITLE:  Cruelty Squad Auto-fisher
#+AUTHOR: 8dcc

*Python script for automatically fishing in Cruelty Squad. Only tested on Linux.*

* Dependencies

#+begin_src console
$ sudo pip install --break-system-packages pyuserinput
#+end_src

* Usage

Simply run the script and follow the instructions. The script needs to be run as
root, and the [[https://crueltysquad.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Vision_Goggles][Night Vision Goggles]] have to be equipped, since the script depends
on the grayscale filter.

#+begin_src console
$ sudo python3 grayscale.py
Getting position in 5 seconds, pause the game and move the mouse to a black area.
Unpause the game. Starting in 3 seconds at position: (X, Y)
Quit by holding F4 for more than 1 seconds.
#+end_src

TODO: Add version without grayscale.
